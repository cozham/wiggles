Thanks to his love of Norah Ephron movies and a love for the, he decided to move to New York City in 2015 to attend Marymount Manhattan College. After realizing that the Upper East Side school wasn't for him, he decided to transfer to The New School where he is currently a Junior studying Journalism and Design. Kyle loves a lot of things including interior design, fried rice, female folk artists from the 1970s, and reality television. He lives in Bushwick in a charming prewar two bedroom, a steal for it's size and location!
